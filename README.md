# Web-Calling-App
#I have made a Video Calling App using WebRTC.
# WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) is a free and open-source project providing web browsers and mobile applications with real-time communication (RTC) via application programming interfaces (APIs). 
#It allows audio and video communication to work inside web pages by allowing direct peer-to-peer communication, 
#eliminating the need to install plugins or download native apps.
